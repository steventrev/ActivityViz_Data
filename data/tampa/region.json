  "SideBarTextLeft": "<br>The Tampa Bay Regional Travel Surveys (TBRTS) program is a comprehensive data collection program designed to support regional and local transportation modeling and transportation planning decisions. This visualization tool is provided regional stakeholders to explore and understand the regional Household Travel Survey and passive data Origin-Destination Tables – two components of the TBRTS.</br><br>The 2018-2019 Tampa Bay Regional Household Travel Survey collected data on daily travel throughout the five-county Tampa Bay region. Over 4,500 households and 9,000 people in Citrus, Hernando, Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties participated. Two-thirds of households were randomly invited through a mailed invitation (probability sample) and one-third through email, advertising, and community outreach efforts. Data were collected between October 2018 and April 2019, when both year-round and seasonal residents are in the region. Participants provided basic demographic details, answered questions about typical travel, and provided a one-day (online / telephone participants) or five-day (smartphone app participants) diary of all household travel.</br><br>The Origin-Destination Tables are derived from passively collected GPS and wifi-beacon location data known as Location Based Services (LBS). Raw LBS data consists of millions of device (typically smartphone) locations and timestamps without demographic or other details of the device owners. The raw data is processed by first cleaning, filtering, and analyzing the location data to identify trips, then crossing with other regional data sources such as surveys and traffic counts to estimate detailed regional travel patterns.</br><br>All data is shown as expanded and weighted to match a typical weekday of travel in 2018.</br><br>To learn more about the survey and its results please contact the <a href='https://www.fdot.gov/info/moredot/districts/dist7.shtm'>Florida Department of Transportation, District 7</a>.</br><br><b>ActivityViz</b> was initially funded by the <a href='https://atlantaregional.org/'>Atlanta Regional Commission</a> with additional support from <a href='https://www.oregonmetro.gov/'>Oregon Metro</a> and others.</br>",
